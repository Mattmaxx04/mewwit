        <h4>Rules</h4>
        <h6>Rule 1</h6>
        <p>
            Remember the human. Mewwit is a place for creating community and belonging, not for attacking marginalized
            or vulnerable groups of people. Everyone has a right to use Mewwit free of harassment, bullying, and threats
            of violence. Post that incite violence or that promote hate based on identity or
            vulnerability will be banned.
        </p>
        <h6>Rule 2
        </h6>
        <p>Abide by community rules. Post authentic content into post where you have a personal interest, and do
            not cheat or engage in content manipulation (including spamming, vote manipulation, ban evasion, or
            subscriber fraud) or otherwise interfere with or disrupt Mewwit communitie.

        </p>
        <h6>Rule 3</h6>
        <p>Respect the privacy of others. Instigating harassment, for example by revealing someone’s personal or
            confidential information, is not allowed. Never post or threaten to post intimate or sexually-explicit media
            of someone without their consent.</p>
